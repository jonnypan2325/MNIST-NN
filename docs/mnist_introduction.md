# Intro to MNIST Dataset


### What is MNIST?

The MNIST dataset was created in 1998, specifically for training machine learning models for pattern recognition. The dataset contaians 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

When training machine learning models, a separate *unseen* testing set is needed for model evaluation. This ensures that the model does not overfit the training set and the traning can be applied generally to unseen data.
