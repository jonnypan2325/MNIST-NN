# About this Project

## Preface

For this tutorial, we will be using the MNIST handwritten digit dataset to task our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for digit classification. 

We will be diving straight into the basics of CNNs for the purpose of getting your hands dirty and learning through experience. Thus, we will not be going over prerequisites such as linear regressors/classifiers, Calculus, and optimization theories. If you prefer to to learn the math and how simple models eventually led to CNNs, I highly recommend you to attend our weekly workshops. More information about the workshops can be found at our AI@UCI discord.

The bare minimum knowledge needed for this self-guided project is proficiency in Python and basic data structures.

## Usage
This website will be your tutorial and main source of information. You can work through the tutorial at your own pace, and all the pages are listed in chronological order. 

Don't hesitate to reach out to any of the Project Coordinators, we are here to help!

Codes will be provided through Google Colab files. This way, you can spend less time setting up your enviornment and get straight to learning about CNNs!

## Friendly Submission/Leaderboard

**Currently under construction**

We will have a submission page where you can submit your model and we will evaluate your model with a non-MNIST test.

Only the highest accuracy model of each participant will be kept. 

Submission cooldown is 24 hours.
